Hi there!

My name is Alberto Almuiña. I am an `R` passionate and a Data Scientist who currently works for [ABANCA](https://www.abanca.com/) in the city of A Coruña.
I started working with `R` several years ago and since then it has become my favorite tool. I really enjoy topics like Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Time Series Forecasting.
I also like to develop R libraries like [bayesmodels](https://github.com/AlbertoAlmuinha/bayesmodels), [garchmodels](https://github.com/AlbertoAlmuinha/garchmodels) or [boostime](https://github.com/AlbertoAlmuinha/boostime).
I've also worked with Python, but I have to admit that I don't feel as comfortable as with R. I also have extensive knowledge of relational databases (such as SQL Server) and ETL tools (such as Informatica PowerCenter)

My favorite subjects are the following:

* Time Series Forecasting
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Model Deployment

## How was this blog forged?

A few months ago I started actively posting posts on LinkedIn and since then I have gone from 200 followers to more than 4000. 
For this reason, I have decided to create a blog where I can share with all my thoughts or tricks about R and related topics.
On specific occasions there will also be a post about technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes or Machine Learning 'tricks' in Python. But in principle, this blog is intended to write about R.


If you have a specific topic you would like me to write about please feel free to reach out. The best option to do so is via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-gonz%C3%A1lez-almui%C3%B1a-b1176881/).
