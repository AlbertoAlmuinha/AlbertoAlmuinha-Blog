**************
## `reformulate()` function
**************

Imagine you want to create an app that imputes the missing values of a certain column. The user will select this column in a slider and you can collect the value on your server.R. Let's see a case:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(recipes)
library(VIM)

data("airquality")

aggr(airquality, prop = F, combined = T, numbers = T, sortVars = T, sortCombs = T)
```

As you can see, we have two columns with missing values. Suppose the user selects the 'Ozone' column. We are going to use the `recipes` package to impute the values with the knn algorithm:

```{r, error=TRUE}
.f<-'Ozone ~ .'

airquality<-recipe(.f, airquality) %>% 
            step_knnimpute(all_outcomes(), neighbors = 3) %>% 
            prep() %>% 
            juice()

```


We get an error because the function is not able to interpret the string as a formula. Let's use the reformulate function to create a formula

```{r}
.f<-reformulate(termlabels = '.', response = 'Ozone')

airquality<-recipe(.f, airquality) %>% 
            step_knnimpute(all_outcomes(), neighbors = 3) %>% 
            prep() %>% 
            juice()

aggr(airquality, prop = F, combined = T, numbers = T, sortVars = T, sortCombs = T)
```

It can be seen that now the function has worked correctly, as we can see in the graph, since we only have one variable with missing values.

### Another Option: `as.formula()` function
****

Another option to achieve the same result is to use the function as.formula().

```{r}
data('airquality')

.f<-as.formula('Ozone ~ .')

airquality<-recipe(.f, airquality) %>% 
            step_knnimpute(all_outcomes(), neighbors = 3) %>% 
            prep() %>% 
            juice()

aggr(airquality, prop = F, combined = T, numbers = T, sortVars = T, sortCombs = T)
```
